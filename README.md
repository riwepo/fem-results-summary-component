## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop first

### What I learned

I learned about nth of type. Took me a while to get it. I was thinking it worked like nth of class, then I got it.

I learned about background gradient.

I learned about BEM class naming. Originally I got it wrong but I think I got it right in the end.
